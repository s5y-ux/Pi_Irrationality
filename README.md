## Overview

This Fortran project implements the Libnitz formula, a simple series for approximating the mathematical constant π (pi). The Libnitz formula is based on an infinite series and is a fun way to calculate π with increasing accuracy as more terms of the series are computed.

The formula used in this project is:

π ≈ 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...)

This project provides a simple Fortran program that allows you to calculate an approximation of π by specifying the number of terms in the series.

## Features

- Calculate an approximation of π using the Libnitz formula.
- Specify the number of terms to compute a more accurate approximation.

## Usage

To use this Fortran program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fortran-pi-approximation.git
